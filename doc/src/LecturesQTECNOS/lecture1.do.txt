=====  Entanglement =====

!bblock
"Entanglement":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11232-007-0098-9.pdf" is the fundamental characteristic that distinguishes
quantum systems composed of two or more coupled objects from their
classical counterparts. The study of entanglement in precisely
engineered quantum systems with countably many degrees of freedom is
at the forefront of modern physics and is a key resource in quantum
information science (QIS). This is particularly true in the
development of two-qubit logic for quantum computation.
!eblock

!bblock
The
generation of two-qubit entanglement has been demonstrated in a wide
variety of physical systems used in present-day quantum computing,
including superconducting circuits, trapped
ions, semiconductor quantum dots, color-center
defects in diamond, and neutral atoms in optical
lattices, just to name a few.
!eblock

!split
===== More on Entanglement =====

!bblock
Generating an entanglement between two quantum systems rely on
exploiting interactions in a controllable way. The details in the
interaction Hamiltonian between two systems defines the protocol
schemes for two-qubit logic.
!eblock

!bblock
In  superconducting circuits the
interaction between qubits may arise from direct capacitive coupling
between circuit elements or by indirect coupling of two qubits to a
common resonator (virtually populating resonator mode) which results
in a non-local Hamiltonian in the form of exchange
interaction. This allow to implement various
schemes for entanglement, such as controlled-phase
gate, resonator-induced phase
gate, cross-resonance gates etc.
!eblock

!split
===== Entanglement gates in trapped ions and more =====

!bblock
Entanglement gates in trapped ions are
produced by means of the Coulomb interaction, where shared motional
modes of two or more ions, entangled to their internal states, used
for transferring excitations between ion
qubits. This has been experimentally
demonstrated.
!eblock


!bblock
In photonic quantum
computing schemes two-qubit entangling operations are realized by
nonlinear interactions between two photons scattering from quantum
dots, plasmonic nanowires, diamond vacancy centers and others embedded
into waveguides. Two-qubit gates in
semiconductor quantum dots are based on spin-spin exchange
interactions or generated
by coupling to a superconducting resonator via artificial spin-orbit
interaction.

===== Defining basis states and quantum mechanical operators =====

We start by defining a state vector $\bm{x}$ (meant to represent
various quantum mechanical degrees of freedom) with $n$ components as

!bt
\[
\bm{x} = \begin{bmatrix} x_0\\ x_1 \\ x_2 \\ \dots \\ \dots \\ x_{n-1} \end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et

Throughout these notes we will use the so-called Dirac _bra-ket_
formalism and we will replace the above standard boldfaced notation
for a vector with

!bt
\[
\bm{x} = \vert x \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} x_0\\ x_1 \\ x_2 \\ \dots \\ \dots \\ x_{n-1} \end{bmatrix},
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\bm{x}^{\dagger} = \langle x \vert = \begin{bmatrix} x_0^* & x_1^* & x_2^* & \dots & \dots & x_{n-1}^* \end{bmatrix},
\]
!et

With a given vector $\vert x \rangle$, we define the inner product as
!bt
\[
\langle x \vert x\rangle = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} x_i^*x_i=x_0^2+x_1^2+\dots + x_{n-1}^2. 
\]
!et

For two arbitrary vectors $\vert x\rangle$ and $\vert y\rangle$ with the same lentgh, we have the
general expression
!bt
\[
\langle y \vert x\rangle = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} y_i^*x_i=y_0^*x_0+y_1^*x_1+\dots + y_{n-1}^*x_{n-1}. 
\]
!et

Note well that the inner product $\langle x \vert x\rangle$ is always a real number while for a two different vectors $\langle y \vert x\rangle$ is in general not equal to
$\langle x \vert y\rangle$, as can be seen from the following example

We note in bypassing that $\vert x\rangle^{\dagger}=\langle x \vert$,
$\langle x\vert^{\dagger}=\vert x\rangle$ and $(\vert
x\rangle^{\dagger})^{\dagger}=\vert x \rangle$.

!split
===== Examples =====

Let us assume that $\vert x \rangle$ is given by
!bt
\[
\vert x \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 1-\imath \\ 2+\imath \end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et
The inner product gives us
!bt
\[
\langle x\vert x \rangle = (1+\imath)(1-\imath)+(2-\imath)(2+\imath)=7,
\]
!et
a real number.
We can use the norm/inner product to normalize the vector $\vert x \rangle$ and obtain
!bt
\[
\vert x \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}}\begin{bmatrix} 1-\imath \\ 2+\imath \end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et

!split
===== More examples =====

As another example, consider the two vectors
!bt
\[
\vert x \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2\imath \\ 1\end{bmatrix},
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\vert y \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0\imath \\ \imath\end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et
We see that the inner products $\langle x\vert y \rangle = -1+\imath$, which is not the same as
$\langle y\vert x \rangle = -1-\imath$. This leads to the important rule
!bt
\[
\langle x\vert y\rangle^* = \langle y \vert x\rangle. 
\]
!et

!split
===== Outer products =====

In addition to inner products between vectors/states, the outer
product plays a central role in all of quantum mechanics. It is
defined as
!bt
\[
\vert x\rangle \langle y \vert = \begin{bmatrix}
               x_0y_0^* & x_0y_1^* & x_0y_2^* & \dots & \dots & x_0y_{n-2}^* & x_0y_{n-1}^* \\
	       x_1y_0^* & x_1y_1^* & x_1y_2^* & \dots & \dots & x_1y_{n-2}^* & x_1y_{n-1}^* \\
	       x_2y_0^* & x_2y_1^* & x_2y_2^* & \dots & \dots & x_2y_{n-2}^* & x_2y_{n-1}^* \\	       
               \dots &   \dots   & \dots  & \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots \\
               \dots &   \dots   & \dots  & \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots \\	       
	       x_{n-2}y_0^* & x_{n-2}y_1^* & x_{n-2}y_2^* & \dots & \dots & x_{n-2}y_{n-2}^* & x_{n-2}y_{n-1}^* \\
	       x_{n-1}y_0^* & x_{n-1}y_1^* & x_{n-1}y_2^* & \dots & \dots & x_{n-1}y_{n-2}^* & x_{n-1}y_{n-1}^* \end{bmatrix}	       
\]
!et


!split
===== Pauli matrices  =====

In quantum computing, the so-called Pauli matrices, and other simple
$2\times 2$ matrices, play an important role, ranging from the setup
of quantum gates to a rewrite of creation and annihilation operators
and other quantum mechanical operators. Let us start with the familiar
Pauli matrices and remind ourselves of some of their basic properties.



The Pauli matrices are defined as
!bt
\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix},
\]
!et
!bt
\[
\sigma_y = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -\imath \\ \imath & 0 \end{bmatrix},
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\sigma_z = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et


!split
===== Further properties =====


It is easy to show that the matrices obey the properties (being involutory)
!bt
\[
\sigma_x\sigma_x = \sigma_y\sigma_y=\sigma_z\sigma_z = I=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1\end{bmatrix},
\]
!et

that is their products with themselves result in the identity matrix
$\bm{I}$.  Furthermore, the Pauli matrices are unitary matrices
meaning that their inverses are equal to their hermitian conjugated
matrices. The determinants of the Pauli matrices are all equal to $-1$,
as can be easily verified.

The Pauli matrices obey also the following commutation rules
!bt
\[
\left[\sigma_x,\sigma_y\right] = 2\imath \sigma_z.
\]
!et

Before we proceed with other matrices and how they can be used to
operate on various quantum mechanical states, let us try to define
various basis sets and their pertinent notations. We will often refer
to these basis states as our computational basis.



!split
===== Definition of Computational basis states =====

Assume we have a two-level system where the two states are represented
by the state vectors $\vert \phi_0\rangle$ and $\vert \phi_1\rangle$,
respectively. These states could represent selected or effective
degrees of freedom for either a single particle (fermion or boson) or
they could represent effective many-body degrees of freedon. In actual
realizations of quantum computing we search often for candidate
systems where we can use some low-lying states as computational basis
states. But we are not limited to quantum computing. When doing
many-body physics, due to the exploding degrees of freedom, we
normally search after effective ways by which we can reduce the
involved dimensionalities to a number of degrees of freedom we can
handle by a given many-body method.


!split
===== Potential wells and single-particle states =====

FIGURE: [qcfigures/doublewell.png, width=700 frac=1.0]



!split
===== Computational basis states =====

We will now relabel the above two states as two orthogonal and normalized basis (ONB) states 
!bt
\[
\vert \phi_0 \rangle = \vert 0 \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix},
\]
!et
and 
!bt
\[
\vert \phi_1 \rangle = \vert 1 \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et

!split
===== Identity matrix and other projection operators =====

It is straight forward to see that $\langle 1 \vert 0\rangle=0$. With these two states we can define the define the identity operator $\bm{I}$ as the sum of the outer products of these two states, namely
!bt
\[
\bm{I} = \sum_{i=0}^{i=1}\vert i\rangle \langle i\vert = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix} +\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et
We can further define the projection operators
!bt
\[
\bm{P} = \vert 0\rangle \langle 0\vert = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix},
\]
!et
and 
!bt
\[
\bm{Q} = \vert 1\rangle \langle 1\vert = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et

We note that $P^2=P$, $Q^2=Q$ (the operators are idempotent) and that
their determinants are zero, meaning in turn that we cannot use these
operators for unitary/orthogonal transformations. However, they play
important roles in defining effective Hilbert spaces for many-body
studies. Finally, before proceeding we note also that the two matrices
commute and we have $\bm{P}\bm{Q}=0$ and $\left[ \bm{P},\bm{Q}\right]=0$.



!split
===== Superposition and more =====

Using the properties of ONBs we can expand a new state in terms of the
above states. These states could also form  a basis which is an
eigenbasis of a selected Hamiltonian (more of this below).

We define now a new state which is a linear expansion in terms of
these computational basis states

!bt
\[
\vert \psi \rangle = \alpha \vert 0 \rangle + \beta\vert 1 \rangle,
\]
!et

where the coefficients $\alpha = \langle 0 \vert \psi \rangle$ and
$\beta =\langle 1 \vert \psi\rangle$ reresent the overlaps between the
computational basis states and the state $\vert \psi\rangle$. In quantum speech, we say the state is in a superposition of the states $\vert 0\rangle$ and $\vert 1\rangle$.

!split
===== Superposition and inner products =====


Computing the inner product of $\vert \psi \rangle$ we obtain
!bt
\[
\langle \psi \vert \psi \rangle = \vert \alpha \vert ^2\langle 0\vert 0\rangle + \vert \beta \vert ^2\langle 1\vert 1\rangle = \vert \alpha \vert ^2 + \vert \beta \vert ^2 = 1,
\]
!et

since the new basis, which is defined in terms of a a unitary/orthogonal
transformation, preserves the orthogonality and norm of the original
computational basis $\vert 0\rangle$ and $\vert 1\rangle$. To see
this, consider the unitary transformation (show derivation of
preserving orthogonality).

If we now act with the projection operators $\bm{P}$ and $\bm{Q}$ on
the state $\vert \psi\rangle$ we get

!bt
\[
\bm{P}\vert \psi \rangle = \vert 0 \rangle\langle 0\vert (\alpha \vert 0 \rangle + \beta\vert 1 \rangle)=\alpha \vert 0\rangle,
\]
!et

that is we _project_ out the $\vert 0\rangle$ component of the state
$\vert \psi\rangle$ with the coefficient $\alpha$ while $\bm{Q}$
projects out the $\vert 1\rangle$ component with coefficient $\beta$
as seen from

!bt
\[
\bm{Q}\vert \psi \rangle = \vert 1 \rangle\langle 1\vert (\alpha \vert 0 \rangle + \beta\vert 1 \rangle)=\beta \vert 1\rangle.
\]
!et

!split
===== Density matrix =====

The above results can easily be derived by multiplying the pertinent
matrices with the vectors $\vert 0\rangle$ and $\vert 1\rangle$,
respectively.

Using the above linear expansion we can now define the density matrix of the state $\vert \psi\rangle$ as the outer product
!bt
\[
\bm{\rho}=\vert \psi \rangle\langle \psi \vert = \alpha\alpha^* \vert 0 \rangle\langle 0\vert+\alpha\beta^* \vert 0 \rangle\langle 1\vert+\beta\alpha^* \vert 1 \rangle\langle 0\vert+\beta\beta^* \vert 1 \rangle\langle 1\vert=\begin{bmatrix} \alpha\alpha^* & \alpha\beta^*\\ \beta\alpha^* & \beta\beta^*\end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et
Finally, we note that the trace of the density matrix is simply given by unity
!bt
\[
\mathrm{tr}\bm{\rho}=\alpha\alpha^* +\beta\beta^*=1.
\]
!et

!split
===== Other important matrices =====

Other operators (as matrices) which play an important role in quantum computing, the so-called Hadamard matrix (or gate)
!bt
\[
\bm{H}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & -1\end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et

The action of the operator $\bm{H}$ on a computational basis state like $\vert 0\rangle$ gives
!bt
\[
\bm{H}\vert 0 \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & -1\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0\end{bmatrix}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\vert 0\rangle + \vert 1\rangle),
\]
!et
and 

!bt
\[
\bm{H}\vert 1 \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & -1\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1\end{bmatrix}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\vert 0\rangle - \vert 1\rangle),
\]
!et
that is we create a superposition of the states $\vert 0\rangle$ and $\vert 1\rangle$.

Another famous operation is the phase matrix given by
!bt
\[
\bm{S} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & \imath\end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et


===== Tensor products =====

Consider now two vectors with length $n=2$, with elements

!bt
\[
\vert x \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} x_0 \\ x_1 \end{bmatrix}, 
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\vert y \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} y_0 \\ y_1 \end{bmatrix}. 
\]
!et
The tensor product of these two vectors is defined as
!bt
\[
\vert x \rangle \otimes \vert y \rangle = \vert xy \rangle  = \begin{bmatrix} x_0y_0 \\ x_0y_1 \\ x_1y_0 \\ x_1y_1 \end{bmatrix}, 
\]
!et
which is now a vector of length $4$.

!split
===== Bringing back the one-qubit basis states =====

If we now go back to our original one-qubit basis states, we can form teh following tensor products
!bt
\[
\vert 0 \rangle \otimes \vert 0 \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0\end{bmatrix} \otimes \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0\end{bmatrix} =\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}=\vert 00 \rangle, 
\]
!et
!bt
\[
\vert 0 \rangle \otimes \vert 1 \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0\end{bmatrix} \otimes \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1\end{bmatrix} =\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}=\vert 01 \rangle, 
\]
!et
!bt
\[
\vert 1 \rangle \otimes \vert 0 \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1\end{bmatrix} \otimes \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0\end{bmatrix} =\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}=\vert 10 \rangle, 
\]
!et
and finally
!bt
\[
\vert 1 \rangle \otimes \vert 1 \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1\end{bmatrix} \otimes \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1\end{bmatrix} =\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}=\vert 11 \rangle. 
\]
!et

!split
===== Four new states =====

We have now four different states and we could try to make a new list
by relabeling the states as follows $\vert 00 \rangle =\vert 0
\rangle$, $\vert 01 \rangle =\vert 1 \rangle$, $\vert 10 \rangle
=\vert 2 \rangle$, $\vert 11 \rangle =\vert 3 \rangle$.

!split
===== Three qubits =====

In similar ways we can define the tensor product of three qubits (or single-particle states) as
!bt
\[
\vert 0 \rangle \otimes \vert 0 \rangle \otimes \vert 0 \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0\end{bmatrix} \otimes \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0\end{bmatrix} \otimes \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\0 \\ 0 \\ 0\end{bmatrix}=\vert 000 \rangle, 
\]
!et
which is a new vector of length eight. We note that with a single-particle basis given the states $\vert 0\rangle$ and $\vert 1\rangle$ we can, with $N$ particles construct $2^N$ different states.
This is something we can generalize to
 * discuss ways of labeling states
 * how to write a code which does it

!split
===== More on the tensor products =====

The tensor product of two $2\times 2$ matrices $\bm{A}$ and $\bm{B}$ is given by

!bt
\[
\bm{A} \otimes \bm{B} = \begin{bmatrix} a_{00} & a_{01} \\ a_{10} & a_{11} \end{bmatrix} \otimes \begin{bmatrix} b_{00} & b_{01} \\ b_{10} & b_{11} \end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix} a_{00} b_{00} &  a_{00}b_{01} & a_{01} b_{00} & a_{01}b_{01} \\
                a_{00} b_{10} &  a_{00}b_{11} & a_{01} b_{10} & a_{01}b_{11} \\
                a_{10} b_{00} &  a_{10}b_{01} & a_{11} b_{00} & a_{11}b_{01} \\
                a_{10} b_{10} &  a_{10}b_{11} & a_{11} b_{10} & a_{11}b_{11} \end{bmatrix}
\]
!et


!split 
===== And more density matrices =====
Using the above linear expansion we can now define the density matrix of the state $\vert \psi\rangle$ as the outer product
!bt
\[
\bm{\rho}=\vert \psi \rangle\langle \psi \vert = \alpha\alpha^* \vert 0 \rangle\langle 0\vert+\alpha\beta^* \vert 0 \rangle\langle 1\vert+\beta\alpha^* \vert 1 \rangle\langle 0\vert+\beta\beta^* \vert 1 \rangle\langle 1\vert=\begin{bmatrix} \alpha\alpha^* & \alpha\beta^*\\ \beta\alpha^* & \beta\beta^*\end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et
Finally, we note that the trace of the density matrix is simply given by unity if the states are properly normalized
!bt
\[
\mathrm{tr}\bm{\rho}=\alpha\alpha^* +\beta\beta^*=1.
\]
!et



!split
===== Measurements =====

The probability of a measurement on a quantum system giving a certain
result is determined by the weight of the relevant basis state in the
state vector. After the measurement, the system is in a state that
corresponds to the result of the measurement. The operators and
gates discussed below are examples of operations we can perform on
specific states.


We  consider the state
!bt
\[
\vert \psi\rangle = \alpha \vert 0 \rangle +\beta \vert 1 \rangle
\]
!et

o A measurement can yield only one of the above states, either $\vert 0\rangle$ or $\vert 1\rangle$.
o The probability of a measurement resulting in $\vert 0\rangle$ is $\alpha^*\alpha = \vert \alpha \vert^2$.
o The probability of a measurement resulting in $\vert 1\rangle$ is $\beta^*\beta = \vert \beta \vert^2$.
o And we note that the sum of the outcomes gives $\alpha^*\alpha+\beta^*\beta=1$ since the two states are normalized.

After the measurement, the state of the system is the state associated with the result of the measurement.

We have already encountered the projection operators $P$ and $Q$. Let
us now look at other types of operations we can make on qubit states.

!split
===== Addition on operators and gates =====


We defined The Pauli matrices as
!bt
\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix},
\]
!et
!bt
\[
\sigma_y = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -\imath \\ \imath & 0 \end{bmatrix},
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\sigma_z = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et


!split
===== Application to one qubit states =====

Before we proceed with other matrices and how they can be used to
operate on various quantum mechanical states, let us try apply these matrices to our one-qubit states.

Assume we operate with $\sigma_x$ on our basis state $\vert 0 \rangle$. This gives
!bt
\[
\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} 0  \\ 1  \end{bmatrix},
\]
!et
that is we switch from $\vert 0\rangle$ to $\vert 1\rangle$ (often called a spin flip operation) and similary we have
!bt
\[
\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} 1  \\ 0  \end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et


!split
===== Quantum mechanical NOT gate =====

This matrix plays an important role in quantum computing since we can
link this with the classical _NOT_ operation.  If we send in bit 0,
the _NOT_ gate outputs bit 1 and vice versa. We can use the $\sigma_x$
matrix to implement the quantum mechanical equivalent of a classical
_NOT_ gate. If we input what we could represent as bit 0 in terms of
the basis state $\vert 0\rangle$, operating on this state results in
the state $\vert 1\rangle$, which we in turn can interpret as the
classical bit 1.


If we have a linear superposition of these states we obtain
!bt
\[
\begin{bmatrix}0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}\alpha \\ \beta \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}\beta \\ \alpha \end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et

The $\sigma_y$ matrix introduces an imaginary sign, which we will later encounter in terms of so-called phase-shift operations.


!split
===== The $\sigma_z$ matrix =====
The $\sigma_z$ matrix has the following effect
!bt
\[
\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} 1  \\ 0  \end{bmatrix},
\]
!et
and 
!bt
\[
\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} 0  \\ -1  \end{bmatrix},
\]
!et
which we can link with a specific phase-shift.

What do the last equations means concerning the two one-qubit states?




Another famous operation is the phase matrix given by
!bt
\[
\bm{S} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & \imath\end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et

	
!split
===== Unitarity =====

The matrices we introduced here are so-called unitary matrices. This
is an important element in quantum mechanics since the evolution of a
closed quantum system is described by operations involving unitary
operations only.

We have defined a new state $\vert \psi_p\rangle$ as a linear expansion in terms of an orthogonal and normalized basis (our computational basis) $\phi_{\lambda}$
!bt
\begin{equation}
\vert \psi_i\rangle = \sum_{j} u_{ij}\vert \phi_{j}\rangle.
\end{equation}
!et


It is normal to choose a basis defined as the eigenfunctions of parts
of the full Hamiltonian. The typical situation consists of the
solutions of the one-body part of the Hamiltonian, that is we have

!bt
\[
\hat{h}_0\vert \phi_{i}\rangle=\epsilon_{i}\vert \phi_{i}\rangle.
\]
!et 

This is normally referred to as a single-particle basis $\vert\phi_{i}(\mathbf{r})\rangle$,
defined by the quantum numbers $i$ and $\mathbf{r}$.

!split
===== Properties of unitary transformations =====

A unitary transformation is important since it keeps the orthogonality.
To see this consider first a basis of vectors $\mathbf{v}_i$,
!bt
\[
\mathbf{v}_i = \begin{bmatrix} v_{i1} \\ \dots \\ \dots \\v_{in} \end{bmatrix}
\]
!et
We assume that the basis is orthogonal, that is 
!bt
\[
\mathbf{v}_j^T\mathbf{v}_i = \delta_{ij}.
\]
!et
An orthogonal or unitary transformation
!bt
\[
\mathbf{w}_i=\mathbf{U}\mathbf{v}_i,
\]
!et
preserves the dot product and orthogonality since
!bt
\[
\mathbf{w}_j^T\mathbf{w}_i=(\mathbf{U}\mathbf{v}_j)^T\mathbf{U}\mathbf{v}_i=\mathbf{v}_j^T\mathbf{U}^T\mathbf{U}\mathbf{v}_i= \mathbf{v}_j^T\mathbf{v}_i = \delta_{ij}.
\]
!et

This means that if the coefficients $u_{p\lambda}$ belong to a unitary
or orthogonal transformation (using the Dirac bra-ket notation)

!bt
\[
\vert \psi_i\rangle = \sum_{j} u_{ij}\vert \phi_{j}\rangle.
\]
!et

orthogonality is preserved.


_Note also_ that although a basis $\left\{\vert \phi_i \rangle\right\}$ contains an infinity of states, for practical calculations we have always to make some truncations. 

!split
===== Example =====

Assume we have two one-qubit states represented by
!bt
\[
\vert \psi \rangle = \alpha \vert 0 \rangle + \beta \vert 1\rangle=\begin{bmatrix}\alpha \\ \beta \end{bmatrix},
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\vert \phi \rangle = \gamma \vert 0 \rangle + \delta \vert 1\rangle=\begin{bmatrix}\gamma \\ \delta \end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et

We assume that the state $\vert \phi \rangle$ is obtained through a
unitary transformation of $\vert \psi \rangle$ through a matrix
$\bm{U}$ with its hermitian conjugate $\bm{U}^{\dagger}$ with matrix
elements $u_{ij}^{\dagger}=u_{ji}^*$ and
$\bm{I}=\bm{U}\bm{U}^{\dagger}=\bm{U}^{\dagger}\bm{U}$.

!split
===== Unitary transformations are reversible =====

Note that this means that the hermitian conjugate of a unitary matrix
is equal to its inverse. This has important consequences for what is
called reversibility. We say quantum mechanics is a theory which is
reversible with a probabilistic determinism. Classical mechanics on
the other is reversible in a deterministic way, that is, knowing all
initial conditions we can in principle determine the future motion of
an object which obey the laws of motion of classical mechanics.

We have then
!bt
\[
\begin{bmatrix}\gamma \\ \delta \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}u_{00} & u_{01} \\ u_{10} & u_{11} \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}\alpha \\ \beta \end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et

Since our original basis $\vert \psi\rangle$ is orthogonal and normalized with $\vert\alpha\vert^2+\vert\beta\vert^2=1$, the new basis is also orthogonal and normalized, as we can see below here.

Since the inverse of a hermitian matrix is equal to its hermitian
conjugate/adjoint), unitary transformations are always reversible.

!split
===== Why are only unitary transformations allowed? =====


Why are only unitary transformations allowed? The key lies in the way the inner product tranforms.

To see this we rewrite the new basis from the previous example in its two components as
!bt
\[
\vert \phi\rangle_i=\sum_{j}u_{ij}\vert \psi\rangle_j,
\]
!et
or in terms of a matrix-vector notatio we have
!bt
\[
\vert \phi\rangle=\bm{U}\vert \psi\rangle,
\]
!et

We have already assumed that $\langle \psi \vert \psi \rangle = \vert\alpha\vert^2+\vert\beta\vert^2=1$.

We have that 
!bt
\[
\langle \phi\vert_i=\sum_{j}u_{ij}^*\langle \psi\vert_j,
\]
!et
or in terms of a matrix-vector notation we have
!bt
\[
\langle \phi\vert=\langle \psi\vert\bm{U}^{\dagger}.
\]
!et

Note that the two vectors are row vectors now.

If we stay with this notation we have

!bt
\[
\langle \phi\vert\phi\rangle = \langle \psi \bm{U}^{\dagger}\bm{U}\vert \psi\rangle = \langle \psi\vert \psi\rangle=1!
\]
!et

Unitary transformations are rotations in state space which preserve the
length (the square root of the inner product) of the state vector.


!split
===== Representation of states and Hamiltonians =====


Before we proceed we need several other definitions.  Throughout these
lectures we will assume that the interacting part of the Hamiltonian
can be approximated by a two-body interaction.  This means that our
Hamiltonian can be written as the sum of a onebody part, which
includes kinetic energy and an eventual external field, and a twobody
interaction




!bt
\begin{equation}
    \hat{H} = \hat{H}_0 + \hat{H}_I 
    = \sum_{i=1}^N \hat{h}_0(x_i) + \sum_{i < j}^N \hat{v}(r_{ij}),
\end{equation}
!et
with 
!bt
\begin{equation}
  H_0=\sum_{i=1}^N \hat{h}_0(x_i).
label{hinuclei}
\end{equation}
!et

The onebody part $u_{\mathrm{ext}}(x_i)$ is normally approximated by a
harmonic oscillator potential or the Coulomb interaction an electron
feels from the nucleus. However, other potentials are fully possible,
such as one derived from the self-consistent solution of the
Hartree-Fock equations.


!split
===== Simple  Hamiltonian models =====



In order to study get started with coding, we will study two simple Hamiltonian systems, one which we can use for a single qubit systems and one which has as basis functions a two-qubit system. These two simple Hamiltonians exhibit also something which is called level crossing, a feature which we will use in later studies of entanglement.

We study first a simple two-level system. Thereafter we
extend our model to a four-level system which can be
interpreted as composed of two separate (not necesseraly identical)
subsystems.

We let our hamiltonian depend linearly on a strength parameter $z$

!bt
\[
       H=H_0+\lambda H_\mathrm{I},
\]
!et

with $\lambda \in [0,1]$, where the limits $\lambda=0$ and $\lambda=1$
represent the non-interacting (or unperturbed) and fully interacting
system, respectively.  The model is an eigenvalue problem with only
two available states, which we label $\vert 0\rangle$ and $\vert
1\rangle$, respectively. Below we will let state $\vert 0 \rangle$
represent the lowest state (often referred to as model-space state)
with its pertinent eigenvalue and eigenvector whereas state $\vert 1\rangle$ represents the eigenvalue of
the excluded space.  The non-interacting solutions to our problem are

!bt
\begin{equation}
       H_0\vert 0 \rangle =\epsilon_0\vert 0 \rangle,
\end{equation}
!et
and
!bt
\begin{equation}
       H_0\vert 1\rangle =\epsilon_1\vert 1\rangle,
\end{equation}
!et

with $\epsilon_0 < \epsilon_1$. We label the off-diagonal matrix
elements $X$, while $X_0=\langle 0 \vert H_I\vert 0 \rangle$ and
$X_1=\langle 1 \vert H_1\vert 1 \rangle$.  The exact eigenvalue
problem

!bt
label{eq:twolevelH}
\begin{equation}
\left(\begin{array}{cc}\epsilon_0+\lambda X_0 &\lambda X \\
\lambda X &\epsilon_1+\lambda X_1 \end{array}\right)
\end{equation}
!et
yields
!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
     label{eq:exact}
     E(\lambda)=&\frac{1}{2}\left\{\epsilon_0 +\epsilon_1 +\lambda X_0
     +\lambda X_1 \pm \left(
     \epsilon_1 -\epsilon_0 +\lambda X_1-\lambda X_0\right) \right. \\ \nonumber
     & \left. \times\sqrt{1+\frac{4\lambda^2X^2}{\left(
     \epsilon_1 -\epsilon_0 +\lambda X_1-\lambda X_0\right)^2}}
     \right\}.
\end{eqnarray}
!et


!split
===== Solutions =====

In the results below we set the parameters $\epsilon_0=0$,
$\epsilon_1=4$, $X_0=-X_1=3$ and $X=0.2$.  This eigenvalue problem can
easily be rewritten in terms of the standard Pauli matrices.  The
non-interacting solutions represent our computational basis.
Pertinent to our choice of parameters, is that at $\lambda\geq 2/3$,
the lowest eigenstate is dominated by $\vert 1\rangle$ while the upper
is $\vert 0 \rangle$. At $\lambda=1$ the $\vert 0 \rangle$ mixing of
the lowest eigenvalue is $1\%$ while for $\lambda\leq 2/3$ we have a
$\vert 0 \rangle$ component of more than $90\%$.  The character of the
eigenvectors has therefore been interchanged when passing $z=2/3$. The
value of the parameter $X$ represents the strength of the coupling
between the model space and the excluded space.  The following code
computes and plots the eigenvalues.

What happens? 

This model exhibits a simple level crossing where the
composition of the final interacting states change character as we
gradually switch on the interaction.



!split
===== Four level systems =====

We extend the simple two-level system to a four level
system. This system can be thought of as composed of two subsystems
$A$ and $B$. Each subsystem has computational basis states

!bt
\[
\vert 0\rangle_{\mathrm{A,B}}=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0\end{bmatrix}^T \hspace{1cm} \vert 1\rangle_{\mathrm{A,B}}=\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}^T.
\]
!et
The subsystems could represent single particles or composite many-particle systems of a given symmetry.
This leads to the many-body computational basis states

!bt
\[
\vert 00\rangle = \vert 0\rangle_{\mathrm{A}}\otimes \vert 0\rangle_{\mathrm{B}}=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 &0\end{bmatrix}^T,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\vert 10\rangle = \vert 1\rangle_{\mathrm{A}}\otimes \vert 0\rangle_{\mathrm{B}}=\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 &0\end{bmatrix}^T,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\vert 01\rangle = \vert 0\rangle_{\mathrm{A}}\otimes \vert 1\rangle_{\mathrm{B}}=\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 &0\end{bmatrix}^T,
\]
!et
and finally
!bt
\[
\vert 11\rangle = \vert 1\rangle_{\mathrm{A}}\otimes \vert 1\rangle_{\mathrm{B}}=\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 &1\end{bmatrix}^T.
\]
!et

These computational basis states define also the eigenstates of the non-interacting  Hamiltonian
!bt
\[
H_0\vert 00 \rangle = \epsilon_{00}\vert 00 \rangle,
\]
!et
!bt
\[
H_0\vert 10 \rangle = \epsilon_{10}\vert 10 \rangle,
\]
!et
!bt
\[
H_0\vert 01 \rangle = \epsilon_{01}\vert 01 \rangle,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
H_0\vert 11 \rangle = \epsilon_{11}\vert 11 \rangle.
\]
!et
The interacting part of the Hamiltonian $H_{\mathrm{I}}$ is given by the tensor product of two $\sigma_x$ and $\sigma_z$  matrices, respectively, that is
!bt
\[
H_{\mathrm{I}}=H_x\sigma_x\otimes\sigma_x+H_z\sigma_z\otimes\sigma_z,
\]
!et
where $H_x$ and $H_z$ are interaction strength parameters. Our final Hamiltonian matrix is given by
!bt
\[
\bm{H}=\begin{bmatrix} \epsilon_{00}+H_z & 0 & 0 & H_x \\
                       0  & \epsilon_{10}-H_z & H_x & 0 \\
		       0 & H_x & \epsilon_{01}-H_z & 0 \\
		       H_x & 0 & 0 & \epsilon_{11} +H_z \end{bmatrix}.
\] 
!et

The four eigenstates of the above Hamiltonian matrix can in turn be used to
define density matrices. As an example, the density matrix of the
first eigenstate (lowest energy $E_0$) $\Psi_0$ is

!bt
\[
\rho_0=\left(\alpha_{00}\vert 00 \rangle\langle 00\vert+\alpha_{10}\vert 10 \rangle\langle 10\vert+\alpha_{01}\vert 01 \rangle\langle 01\vert+\alpha_{11}\vert 11 \rangle\langle 11\vert\right),
\]
!et

where the coefficients $\alpha_{ij}$ are the eigenvector coefficients
resulting from the solution of the above eigenvalue problem.

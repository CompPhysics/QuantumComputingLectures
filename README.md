# Quantum Computing Lectures for  Nano and Quantum Workshop, Cali, Colombia, December 4-8, 2023

The websiate for this set of lectures is https://github.com/CompPhysics/QuantumComputingLectures.
Feel free to navigate the different folders and use as you like.

The aim of this set of lectures is to demonstrate how we can use
quantum computing to find for example the eigenvalues and eigenstates
of quantum mechanical many-body systems.  After having introduced some
of the basic notations and formalism (see below), we focus on how to
implement the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm for
finding the eigenvalues of selected Hamiltonians.  We will focus on a
well-studied model for the Hamiltonian, the so-called Lipkin
model. Using this model we will show how to find the eigenvalues.
Hands-on jupyter-notebooks will be used to demonstrate how one can
simulate such quantum mechanical systems, using either own codes or
the functionality provided by a software like Qiskit
https://qiskit.org/.

The lectures will also serve as a wy to motivate physical realization (quantum engineering) of different circuits and gates.
